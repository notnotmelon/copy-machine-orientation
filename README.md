### This mod will paste entity rotations when you shift click machines

- Pipe connections on assemblers, chemical plants, and all other crafting machines will copy
- Also works for inserters, splitters, pumps, offshore pumps, and combinators

Copy paste doesn't raise a mod event on furnaces or generators, which means I can't rotate them. Sorry!

If a copying a machine's direction will make that machine go off grid, or make it collide with other machines, it is not rotated

There is another version of this mod here:
https://mods.factorio.com/mod/CopyAssemblerPipeDirection
The problem with this mod is that it only works with vanilla assembling machines
It doesn't copy directions for chemical plants, refineries, or any other modded machine
